# TERRA CONTRACT UTILS
Utilities for Terra blockchain interactions such as upload, init, query smart contract implemented with Typescript.

### How to use?
1. Clone this repository to your machine. (I usually make a `scripts` folder under the smart contract repository for this utils.)
2. Setup artifact path and other params in `config.json`
3. Run `yarn ts-node <filename>` to apply the script.

### Example
Run `yarn ts-node src/deploy.ts` to upload the artifact and init the smart contract with a single command.
